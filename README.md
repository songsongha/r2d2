R2-D2 Exercise
The year is 1977, Star Wars: A New Hope has just been released. The true hero of the film, R2-D2 has acquired Death Star plans and needs to deliver them to Obi Wan Kenobi on the surface of Tatooine to help ensure victory for the rebellion. The problem is that upon landing R2-D2 has lost all autonomy and needs your to help guide him safely to Obi Wan Kenobi through manual commands.

Description
The application is a simulation of R2-D2 landing on Tatooine, the goal is to deliver the plans to Obi Wan at his location by entering manual commands
The planet is conveniently a 100x100 grid
R2-D2 is free to roam around the surface of the Tatooine, but must be prevented from falling off the edge because it is apparently a flat planet
Any movement that would result in R2-D2 falling must be prevented, however further valid movement commands must still be allowed
On R2-D2 successfully reaching Obi Wan Kenobi we should celebrate our success and exit the application
Requirements
Acceptable Commands
LAND

randomly place R2-D2 on the planet
randomly place Obi Wan Kenobi on the planet
report the location of both R2-D2 and Obi Wan as a grid coordinate and facing direction
The origin (0,0) can be considered to be the SOUTH WEST most corner. - If R2-D2 has already landed ignore this command
MOVE (x) will move R2-D2 (x) units forward in the direction it is currently facing

LEFT and RIGHT will rotate R2-D2 90 degrees in the specified direction without changing the position of the robot

REPORT report the location of both R2-D2 and Obi Wan as a grid coordinate and facing direction

Constraints
R2-D2 must not fall off the table during movement. This also includes the initial placement of the toy robot.
Any move that would cause the robot to fall must be ignored
